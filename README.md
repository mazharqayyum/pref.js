This is the JavaScript file used in a YouTube tutorial called [A deep dive into optimizing LCP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWoI9DXmpdk) by Philip Walton from [Chrome for Developers](https://www.youtube.com/@ChromeDevs) channel. 
This file was missing in the tutorial, and was recreated to help complete the tutorial. This would help people who are following the tutorial to reduce their LCP time, and are looking for this missing resource. 

All the credit for creating this orignal script goes to the team at [Chrome for Developers](https://www.youtube.com/@ChromeDevs) channel.

### How to install this script
* Download pref.js file, and place it inside you website root for example under wwwroot/scripts folder.
* Include this script into your page HTML just above the closing body tag as external script.
  
  `<script type="text/javascript" src="/scripts/pref.js" async></script>`
* Now you can browse you website in Chrome, and open developer tools
* Go to Performance tab, and start recording the page load timings.
